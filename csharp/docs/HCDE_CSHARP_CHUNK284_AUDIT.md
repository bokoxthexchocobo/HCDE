| **Out-of-body removed** | **150** |
| **Honest** | **0** |


## Tests


## Verified

`dotnet build csharp/HCDE.sln -warnaserror`; `dotnet test csharp/HCDE.sln`; `python3 tools/reaudit_chunks.py audit --from 284 --to 284` (0 hard / 0 soft).

## Seams

Native engine globals and VM dispatch are not re-hosted; only credited control flow is modeled.

## Credit rationale

Only lines whose control flow and validation are exercised by the named `[Fact]` methods above are credited; scanner framing and VM hooks outside those paths are not counted.
