# Building

### Requirements

- CMake `>= 3.16`
- C++20 compiler
- Python `>= 3.6` (resource/packaging scripts)
- Threads package

The CMake project can use bundled/internal or system variants for some libraries (e.g., bzip2, cppdap), and links engine deps like ZMusic/ZVulkan/ZWidget/webp/lzma/abseil.

### Windows (Visual Studio) quick build

```powershell
cmake -S C:\path\to\HCDE -B C:\path\to\HCDE\build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build C:\path\to\HCDE\build --config Release
```

Typical outputs:

- `C:\path\to\HCDE\build\Release\hcde.exe`
- `C:\path\to\HCDE\build\Release\hcdeserv.exe`
- `C:\path\to\HCDE\build\Release\hcdercon.exe`

### Linux quick build

```bash
cmake -S /path/to/HCDE -B /path/to/HCDE/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /path/to/HCDE/build -j
```

### Runtime DLLs (Windows developer builds)

`hcde.exe` requires two third-party runtime DLLs alongside it for full
audio support. Releases ship them; from-source Windows builds pick them
up automatically when present.

| DLL              | Used for                                  | How to provide it |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `soft_oal.dll`   | OpenAL sound effects (positional 3D SFX)  | Drop OpenAL Soft into `build\` and `build\RelWithDebInfo\`. |
| `sndfile.dll`    | OGG / FLAC / WAV music decoding (ZMusic)  | Place in `build\deps\`, `build\`, or set `-DHCDE_SNDFILE_RUNTIME_DLL=<path>`. |

The `zdoom` target runs `cmake/StageSndFileRuntime.cmake` as a
`POST_BUILD` step on Windows, which copies `sndfile.dll` (and any
matching license file) into the executable directory and resource
directory. A warning is printed if the DLL cannot be located; vanilla
MUS/MIDI music still plays without it.
