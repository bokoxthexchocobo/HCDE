# HCDE

HCDE is a Doom-engine project focused on multiplayer, mod compatibility, and dedicated-server workflows.

## Documentation (Wiki)

How-to guides and reference docs live on the [HCDE Wiki](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/wiki).

## What ships in this repo

| Binary | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `hcde` | Client / game executable |
| `hcdeserv` | Dedicated server |
| `hcdercon` | Local RCON utility for dedicated-server admin commands |

Master protocol constants live in `protocol/` so engine, launcher, and master stay separate (`protocol/hcde_master_protocol.json`, `protocol/hcde_master_protocol.h`).

## Quick build

**Windows (Visual Studio):**

```powershell
cmake -S C:\path\to\HCDE -B C:\path\to\HCDE\build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build C:\path\to\HCDE\build --config Release
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cmake -S /path/to/HCDE -B /path/to/HCDE/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /path/to/HCDE/build -j
```

See [Building](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/wiki/Building) for requirements, output paths, and Windows runtime DLLs (`soft_oal.dll` for SFX, `sndfile.dll` for OGG/FLAC/WAV music — auto-staged via `cmake/StageSndFileRuntime.cmake`). [Getting Started](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/wiki/Getting-Started) covers hosting/joining a dedicated server and starting a single-player Invasion match.

## Recent updates

- Windows desktop OpenGL backend is auto-routed to OpenGL ES at startup so a stale `vid_preferbackend 0` config no longer black-screens after the splash. Vulkan stays the default Windows backend; tracked in [#31](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/issues/31).
- Single-player startup now shows a real "HCDE is loading..." window during ZDL command-line resolution, IWAD/mod scanning, compat patching, and archive mounting, so the window can't appear, vanish, then reappear minutes later.
- NanoBSP loader (`hcde_nanobsp_loader`, `r_nanobsp_status`) and the Eternity spatial-audio facade (`snd_backend eternity`, `snd_eternity_status`) shipped — board items [#4](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/issues/4) and [#3](https://github.com/bokoxthexchocobo/HCDE/issues/3).
- Single-player Invasion (`sv_gametype 4`) starts cleanly, including from external launchers that pass `+set sv_gametype 4` (Doom Connector, ZDL, etc.). Invasion announcements are HCDE-styled ("Prepare for Invasion! Wave 1 starting in 5,4,3,2,1.. BEGIN!" / "Wave N complete!").
- `hcde_lag_hud` and `hcde_hud_debug` are decoupled — the perf/lag overlay is opt-in (`hcde_lag_hud 1`) instead of being forced on by the diagnostic-logging gate.
- Music lookup prioritizes mod-nested `music/` folders so OGG-only mods (e.g. `D2Re.pk3`) play correctly when `sndfile.dll` is staged.
- Single-player death/respawn is robust to autosave failures; respawn input is buffered through the death delay.
